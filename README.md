# Portal 2 Puzzle Structure Designer
*Makes portal 2 puzzle layouts and designs according to user settings. Doesn't help you with making your puzzles look good.*

Similar to and inspired by Mikeastro's foursight series and the computer program behind it, but more complex. Uses the same basic structure, such as islands and connections.
